# Umbraco custom macro parameters

A collection of custom macro paramters that I use in multiple projects

### Multiple content picker
Makes it possible to select more than one content site. Adds same functionality for macros as this built in property editor: https://our.umbraco.org/documentation/Getting-Started/Backoffice/Property-Editors/Built-in-Property-Editors/Multinode-Treepicker

### Related links picker 
Makes it possible to add related links. Adds same functionality for macros as this built in property editor: https://our.umbraco.org/documentation/getting-started/backoffice/property-editors/built-in-property-editors/related-links

### Rich text editor 
Makes it possible to use a rich text editor as a macro parameter. (Issues with adding anchors in Internet Explorer)
